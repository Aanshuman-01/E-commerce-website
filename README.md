# E-commerce-website
This is a simple but fully responsive website developed in HTML, css, JavaScript to simulate an online shopping experience.
The website contains multiple sections or pages like home, shop, blog, about, contact and cart section.The shop page also extend to the sub page i.e product details page in which the detail of the product that the user want to buy is explained.
The site includes features like product listings, a shopping cart, and basic checkout flowâ€”all handled entirely on the client side.
I used HTML for the structure, CSS to style the layout and make it responsive, and JavaScript to manage dynamic interactions like adding/removing items from the cart and updating the total price in real-time.
